Final Project Overview 

Work with your lab groups and use one of the areas below to answer a broad question(s) related to a given dataset.  Some dataset resources are list below for you to potential use, but you are also welcomed to use a dataset you have used in the past or is not a part of the listed resources.  Do not use a dataset from class. Similar to the mid-term please present a cleanly knitted final presentation that walks the reader through your project step by step. 
General topics we will/have covered that can be a focus of the final project (feel free to combine topics or extend them) 
•	Data Visualization – interactive or static 
•	Text Mining
•	kNN
•	Clustering - Kmeans
•	Decision Trees
•	Ensemble – Random Forrest or other Ensemble Tree Method

Generate a publishable Rmarkdown document with the following sections:
•	Question and background information on the data and why you are asking this question(s).  References to previous research/evidence generally would be nice to include. – You must present your question to me during office hours, either next week on  26th or the following week on the 3rd  
•	Exploratory Data Analysis – Initial summary statistics and graphs with an emphasis on variables you believe to be important for your analysis. 
•	Methods – Techniques you are using to address your question and the results of those methods.
•	Evaluation of your model – Select appropriate metrics and explain the output as it relates to your question.
•	Fairness assessment – if necessary, should you happen to have any protected classes.
•	Conclusions – What can you say about the results of the methods section as it relates to your question given the limitations to your model. 
•	Future work – What additional analysis is needed or what limited your analysis on this project.
