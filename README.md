A little bit about the course

What is Data Science, why is it becoming so important and what is needed to be successful in this field? We will explore these questions throughout the course through a variety of topics with data always at the center.  In all things, we focus on creative thinking, not blind implementation. If you cannot answer why you are doing something, not only will you discover no new knowledge but you will also create new problems versus solving them.

The course centers on lab-based work and employs a team-based pedagogy, meaning much of the work in the course can and should be completed in collaboration with your classmates.  Though very applied, we also include theoretical content and will have discussion sessions depending on the topic for any given week.  Much of the class is also "flipped" meaning lecture is limited and practice is emphasized.

I am also aware that students come from different backgrounds and have a variety of skillsets that they bring to the class.  There will be plenty of opportunities for those that would like to take advantage of extra discussions during office hours, TA support sessions, and team-based work that is designed in such a way that we can all learn from each other.   

Throughout the course, we will endeavor to “live the life of a data scientist” allowing you to not only be directly taught but gain a sense of what it would be like to be working as a data scientist.  You’ll be asked to discover new knowledge and share it with your peers and learn how to use the larger ecosystem of data science to your benefit.  

 

What you’ll learn along the way

Data Science is incredibly broad and dynamic. The topics below are designed to reinforce this perspective and help you understand the field’s core tenements and what is demanding from practicing data scientists.  The key outcome would be for you to gain a sense of the scope of Data Science, what is needed to contribute to the community, and feel comfortable incorporating these techniques into your work moving forward.

    describe the field of Data Science at large and its emerging sub-fields
    communicate Data Science products
    avoid the negative outcomes associated with ML/AI bias
    demonstrate effective techniques for displaying data visually
    articulate the advantages and disadvantages of certain machine learning modeling approaches
    select appropriate machine learning models given problems and data types
    how to evaluate machine learning models

The course will move rather quickly and can be demanding at times. However, if we all work together to support each other you’ll be amazed how much you learn at the end of the semester!


How you’ll know you are learning

On any given week, the course will require reviewing short video lectures and completing readings prior to coming to class.  These lectures and readings will then be implemented in the lab portion of the course which will be conducted during the scheduled class period.  Lab sessions will include a variety of activities but mostly be centered on team-oriented coding assignments.  Students can also use lab sessions to work on mid-term and final projects when needed.

    Ethical data scientist reflection (10%) – Based on in-class discussion and readings 
    students will write a personal reflection of how ethics and data science interact and how we all can think 
    about these concerns moving forward. This is critical to the work of a data scientist as the models we 
    build have the potential to impact the lives of thousands of people so we must use caution and constraint whenever possible.
    
    Quizzes (10%) – Short occasional (5 or 6) quizzes, will be auto-graded, so you will get instant feedback. In order 
    to ensure we are all meeting the learning objectives from week to week short quizzes will be given. You will be allowed 
    as many chances to complete the quiz as needed and they will be open note however students are to work independently.  
    (To be completed Independent unless otherwise stated)
    
    Labs (40%) – On most weeks we will have in-class labs/assignments. These are designed to allow you to practice the skills 
    being presented in class. While they should be submitted individually you are encouraged to work with your peers as much of the
    best learning can come from your peers. You’ll need to create publishable markdown documents for every lab and submit them along 
    with the raw code file and link each week (Groups).   
    
    Package Overview Project (15%) (Mid-Term) – Select an R package of interest and publish a markdown document with an overview of the 
    package's contents, example problems the package could solve, and example code of the package in use. you will vote on the top presentations 
    (Groups of 3). This is designed to reinforce using Rmarkdown as a communications tool, communication data-related work and to give you a sense 
    of the world of possibilities that open-source programming languages provide. (Assigned Groups)

    Final project (25%) – The course will culminate in a final project that will involve working with a dataset of your choice, giving a presentation, 
    submitting well-annotated code to include summary information in report form. This is an open-ended project designed to allow 
    groups to choose a topic of interest from the semester to explore deeper and share with the class.
