# Lab Overview 

Key Points to Cover
* Developing DS questions
* Developing metrics associated with question
* Target variables 
* Type of Model 
* Data Brainstorming
* Incorporating a Data Science perspective to problem solving

Read through the case study and then discuss the problem as a group then address these questions below:

* What problems are facing the organization? 
* Given the data provided, what problem(s) could potential be solved? 
* How would you know the solution was working? 
* What is your target variable and what type of solution are you developing? 
* Work through the following Data to Concept and Learning Difficulty questions presented from this weeks lecture:
  * How difficult is the data to gather?
  * How well does the data match your problem?
  * Has the data been used in the past with success?
  * Is the target difficult to measure or break into smaller parts?
  * What level of uncertainty (risk) are you willing to accept? 

Take 45 to an hour to gather your answers then we will discuss. I do want you to submit a written summary of the results so it might be a good idea to assign a note taker.
