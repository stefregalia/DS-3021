```{r}

#What mental models can we see from this data? What questions can we ask? 

View(as.tibble(iris3))
#What about this one? What question can we ask with this data? 

```

## Let's look at a quick K Nearest Neighbour Example
```{r}
#?knn
train <- rbind(iris3[1:25,,1], iris3[1:25,,2], iris3[1:25,,3])
#What do we mean by training data? 
test <- rbind(iris3[26:50,,1], iris3[26:50,,2], iris3[26:50,,3])
#Why is testing a thing? 
target <- factor(c(rep("s",25), rep("c",25), rep("v",25)))
View(cl)
#What is a target? 
knn_model <- knn(train, test, target, k = 3, prob=TRUE)
# How did we do?
summary(knn_model)
table(target)

# How would we use this model? 
# How would we know if it's working?

#Adjust the k value higher and see what happens, did it get better?
```

## What patterns are being learned here?
```{r}
#Do we seen pattern difference? 
tapply(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Species, summary)#?tapply, used to apply a function to a factor in a dataframe. 

tapply(iris$Sepal.Width, iris$Species, summary)

tapply(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Species, summary)

tapply(iris$Petal.Width, iris$Species, summary)
?tapply

#Where is the model error? 
summary(knn_model)
table(target)            
            
            
            
            #q1 = quantile(x, 0.25),
            median = median(x),
            mean = mean(x),
            q3 = quantile(x, 0.75),
            max = max(x))

```
