## Goals for Today
* You learn something
* I learn something
* Everyone makes a PR to this repo (details at end)

## Today's Dataset
* We will be using a mystery dataset today: [mystery data](https://www.17lands.com/public_datasets)

1. Download the data
2. Un zip the data
3. Load the data into a dataframe
4. Make a scatter plot of << insert two variables here >>
